# Drawers &amp; Bits
Drawers &amp; Bits is an addon for the Minecraft mods [Chisels &amp; Bits](http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/231095-chisels-bits) by AlgorithmX2 and [Storage Drawers](http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/223852-storage-drawers) by jaquadro. The mod adds special drawers and support for bits.

Currently the mod adds one block, the bit drawer. It basically works similar to a compacting drawer by automatically converting between bits and the full block. It can only store blocks that can be broken down into bits. Otherwise it acts as any drawer, aka it can be part of a drawer controller network, accepts upgrades and can be locked etc.

*IMPORTANT:* Currently left-clicking with a bit in your hand cannot be detected, therefore if you pull out bits and the first goes into your active slot, you cannot pull out more. Switch to a different item or an empty hand to continue pulling out.

A small warning, since a block has 4096 bits the drawer gets close to how much can be reasonably stored internally in a number. With default settings you are fine, but if you upgrade the storage capacity of the bit drawer or upgrades in the config, you will rapidly hit the limit (at 8191 stacks Ã  64 blocks).

This mod highly relies on the version of storage drawers, so it can break with an update. I will try to fix that as soon as I notice.
