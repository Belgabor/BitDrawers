# Changelog

## Version ?
* [NEW] Bit Drawer Controller

## Version 0.21
* Due to intimate dependencies on Chisels & Bits and Storage Drawers I can no longer keep backwards compatibility 
* [FIXED] Compatibility with Storage Drawers 3.2.2 (Belgabor/DrawersBits#2). This version is tagged to be only compatible with 3.2.2 as I can already see it will break with the next version
* [FIXED] Compatibility with Chisels & Bits 11.6+ (required)

## Version 0.2
* [NEW] Bag interaction
* [NEW] Design interaction, custom slot
* [NEW] Chiseled block interaction
